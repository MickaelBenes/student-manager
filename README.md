# student-manager project

Fullstack application allowing professors to manage their students' skills in computer science.

It contains two modules :
*	**student-manager-restapi**  
	A RESTfull API written in Java with **Spring Boot**.
*	**student-manager-site**  
	An **Angular 4** app consuming the API.

The only purpose of this was to train myself on Java, discover Spring and Angular 2. And also REST services. Was a nice way to see it all. :)

Might do the front app with AngularJS too, 'cause at the moment companies seem to be using it more than Angular 2+.  
I only base that on my own experience. I was looking for a new job some time ago and I came across many offers of an AngularJS developer, really not Angular 2+ (yeah I asked during the interview).

I mainly used :
*	Angular [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) tutorial
*	Spring Boot [Building REST services with Spring](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/bookmarks/) tutorial
